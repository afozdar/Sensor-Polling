# Sensor-Polling
### Overview
Sensor polling is one of two components in this anomaly detection tool:

1. Sensor polling and data collection, via automated sensors within the smart home
2. An [anomaly detection algorithm] (https://github.com/Merit-Research/BLR-Detection-Alg) 

Sensor-Polling is responsible for retrieving data from [Z-Wave] (http://www.z-wave.com/what_is_z-wave) 
compliant smart home sensors and supplying it to the [detection algorithm] (https://github.com/Merit-Research/BLR-Detection-Alg)
in the correct format.
